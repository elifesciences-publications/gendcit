Gender differences in average. Journal impact factors were Gender differences in Journal Impact Factor scores were statistically insignificant (women: 3.27 ± 0.43, men: 2.67 ± 0.1, p= 0.063). The inconsequential results may be due to the small number of women included in the comparisons.

Median-based gender differences for m-quotients were smaller and statistically insignificant (women: 0.41, men: 0.57, p=.09). This inconsequential result may be due to the samples used in the comparisons.

No statistically significant gender differences in H-indices were identified for associate and full professors (numerical results and stratified sample sizes not reported). Likewise, no statistically significant differences were detected in the cumulative citation impact of women and men across the three ranks (numerical results and stratified sample sizes not reported). The inconsequential results may be explained by the small samples employed in each of the sub-group analyses.

The number of women at the full professor and department chair level was too small for meaningful statistical comparison.

[@Winnik2012]	Cardiovascular research	Observation	US	590 authors, 96 women	2006	Abstracts submitted to the European Society of Cardiology Congress in 2006	Papers cited more than 10 times within 2 years after publication 	Logistic regression 	Both the gender of first authors (Male N: 217, Female N: 71) and last authors (Male N: 259, Female N: 25) were found to be insignificant predictors of producing papers with +10 citations. First authors (male = 0, female=1): Odds ratio: 1.34 (95% CI=0.066-2.73). Last authors (male= 0, female=1): Odds ratio: 0.22 (95% CI: 0.003-1.66). These inconsequential result may be explained by the small sample of women included in the analyses.
